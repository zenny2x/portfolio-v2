# Portfolio-V2
This is a second new and improved version of my last portfolio, which will be updated depending on how im feeling

## Discord Profile
We use react-use-lanyard which uses a lanyard websocket in order to obtain the data of our discord account

## Techstack so far
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn
- React + Vite(I use vite because I dont need any SEO for my portfolio whereas NextJS is kinda confusing to me since it adds a bunch of features ro react)
